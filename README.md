# EchoSense-Predictive-Analytics

An innovative AI-powered system designed to analyze ECG data and predict cardiac conditions. This project leverages supervised machine learning to classify heart conditions and provide insights for early cardiac risk assessment using the annotated CODE-15% dataset.

## Features
- **Intelligent ECG Analysis**: Harnesses supervised learning for detailed cardiac condition classification.
- **Predictive Risk Assessment**: Provides early predictions to assist in proactive health monitoring.
- **Scalable and Robust**: Built for handling large datasets like CODE-15%, ensuring reliability and flexibility.
- **Modern AI Framework**: Employs advanced preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization techniques.



## Dataset
This project utilizes the **CODE-15% dataset**, a large-scale, annotated dataset containing:
- **345,779 ECG exams** from **233,770 patients**.
- Labeled cardiac conditions for machine learning tasks.

**Dataset Source**: [Zenodo - CODE-15%](https://zenodo.org/record/4916206)
