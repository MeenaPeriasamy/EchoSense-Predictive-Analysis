# EchoSense: Predictive Analysis of Cardiac Health

## Project Overview
EchoSense is an advanced predictive healthcare application designed to analyze electrocardiogram (ECG) images for potential cardiac issues. By utilizing deep learning models, EchoSense can predict the likelihood of various cardiac conditions, providing crucial insights into cardiac health.

## Features
- **ECG Image Analysis:** Upload ECG images and receive instant analysis and predictions.
- **Health Risk Prediction:** Identifies potential cardiac risks like myocardial infarction, abnormal heartbeats, and previous myocardial damage.
- **Detailed Health Insights:** Provides detailed descriptions of identified conditions, helping in early diagnosis and management.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- Tkinter for GUI

## How It Works
1. Upload an ECG image using the intuitive GUI.
2. The model analyzes the image and predicts potential cardiac conditions.
3. The application displays the main category of heart condition and a detailed breakdown of possible sub-conditions and their implications.

## Getting Started
To run EchoSense locally:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the application: `python echosense_app.py`.
