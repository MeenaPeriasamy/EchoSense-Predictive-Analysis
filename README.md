# EchoSense: Predictive Analysis of Cardiac Health

## Project Overview
EchoSense is a project focused on leveraging machine learning to classify electrocardiogram (ECG) images into various categories indicative of heart conditions. The project is implemented in two distinct approaches: locally using Jupyter Notebook and on the cloud via Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with Vertex AI.

## Approach 1: Local Analysis using Jupyter Notebook

### Description
This approach involves using Python and libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PIL in a Jupyter Notebook environment to process and classify ECG images. The local environment allows for detailed and iterative development, suitable for experiments and prototype development.

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- PIL (Pillow)

### Setup and Execution
1. **Setup Python Environment**:
   - Ensure Python and pip are installed.
   - Install dependencies: `pip install notebook tensorflow keras numpy pillow`.

2. **Running the Notebook**:
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`.
   - Open the `EchoSense_Analysis.ipynb` file.
   - Execute the cells sequentially to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.

### Data Structure
- Data should be organized in directories under `data/`, categorized by conditions such as `Normal`, `Abnormal Heartbeat`, etc.

## Approach 2: Cloud Analysis using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Vertex AI

### Description
Using GCP's Vertex AI, this approach leverages the power of cloud computing to handle larger datasets and more complex models with ease. It allows for scalable model training, deployment, and management.

### Requirements
- Google Cloud account
- Setup GCP project and enable Vertex AI API
- Access to Google Cloud Storage

### Setup and Execution
1. **Data Upload**:
   - Upload your dataset to Google Cloud Storage in the appropriate bucket.

2. **Creating Dataset in Vertex AI**:
   - Navigate to Vertex AI in the Google Cloud Console.
   - Create a new dataset and import images from the storage bucket.

3. **Training the Model**:
   - Configure and start training using AutoML or custom training options based on the dataset.
   - Monitor training progress in Vertex AI.

4. **Model Evaluation and Deployment**:
   - Evaluate the trained model using Vertex AI's evaluation metrics.
   - Deploy the model for online or batch predictions.

### Monitoring and Management
- Use Vertex AI's dashboard to manage models and check their performance metrics.
- Deploy models and make them accessible through Google's endpoints for applications.

## Conclusion
EchoSense provides two robust methodologies for ECG image analysis, tailored for different environments and scales, from local development to comprehensive cloud-based solutions.
